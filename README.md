 building a task management system. It was exciting but also a bit scary since I was new to the tech I needed: FastAPI, React, and PostgreSQL.I hadn't used FastAPI, React, or PostgreSQL before, so starting this project felt like jumping into the deep end.
 But I was up for the challenge.At first, I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. Learning new stuff is tough, but I was eager to see what I could build.I have learned a lot of things by building this project.i had faced alot of problems 
like auth, then i keep trying to solve it and found many useful resources online. my sister also helped me.
then i finally build task management system with some functionalities and in more user-friendly way.I wont give up on this project ill learn more and try to add more things to my project.


challenges i have faced is and how i tackled it :

implementing user authentication and authorization features , especially when dealing with secure user authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens):

             *To overcome this challenge, I dedicated time to thoroughly understanding the JWT authentication process and how it integrates with FastAPI and React.
             *I researched best practices and try to learn more about jwt.

Integrating the frontend (React) with the backend (FastAPI) was very challenging, especially when setting up communication between them via APIs:

              *To tackle this challenge, I first established a clear understanding of how APIs work and how data is exchanged between the frontend and backend.
              *I carefully designed the API endpoints in FastAPI to align with the requirements of the frontend components in React.

mark as completed checkbox was challenging for me, while creating and implementing it it wasnt working correctly:

              *To address this challenge, I carefully reviewed the code implementation and debugged the functionality to identify any errors or issues.
               *I utilized browser developer tools and logging statements to track the flow of data.


lessons i have learnt is that:

1. I learned the importance of gaining a thorough understanding of the technologies I'm working with, especially when dealing with complex features like user authentication with JWT and integrating frontend and backend technologies like React and FastAPI. 

2.by overcoming the challenges such as integrating FastAPI with React and implementing features like the "mark as completed" checkbox, CRUD I honed my problem-solving skills and i learnt how to find solution for problems.

3. dont give up, i have learnt the way to solve any problems by breaking them into smaller parts and solve those with our logic through code.
