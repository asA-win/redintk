 building a task management system. It was exciting but also a bit scary since I was new to the tech I needed: FastAPI, React, and PostgreSQL.I hadn't used FastAPI, React, or PostgreSQL before, so starting this project felt like jumping into the deep end.
 But I was up for the challenge.At first, I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. Learning new stuff is tough, but I was eager to see what I could build.I have learned a lot of things by building this project.i had faced alot of problems 
like auth, then i keep trying to solve it and found many useful resources online. my sister also helped me.
then i finally build task management system with some functionalities and in more user-friendly way.I wont give up on this project ill learn more and try to add more things to my project.
